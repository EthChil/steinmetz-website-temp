						Mission
					</div>
					<div>
						Steinmetz is on a mission to re-accelerate the electrification of the entire world.
						The electric powertrain provides a theoretically perfect form of energy transfer.
						Energy can be converted to various forms with nearly 100% efficiency.

						<br><br>
						Despite the boons of this miraculous technology, today we live in a world of expensive, heavy and unreliable electric vehicles.
						Steinmetz is setting out to solve this issue by creating cost-effective, highly-performant, and easy to use subsystems for EVs and Robotics.
						<br><br>
						In the coming decades we will see a complete electrification of society from cars to planes to boats to labor.
						The platform of that society will be built on Steinmetz.
